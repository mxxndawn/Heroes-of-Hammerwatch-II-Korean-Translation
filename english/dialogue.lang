	<string name="dialogue.adam.intro.shout">Help!</string>
	<string name="dialogue.adam.intro.prompt1">The cult found our camp and attacked!</string>
	<string name="dialogue.player.intro.response1">What's going on?</string>
	<string name="dialogue.adam.intro.prompt2">Will you please help, we're not soldiers, they'll kill everyone!</string>
	<string name="dialogue.player.intro.response2">Of course!</string>
	<string name="dialogue.adam.intro.prompt3">Thank you! Usually it's just the goblins who are a threat, but they've been managable.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.adam.intro.prompt4">Recently cultists have been more active and ventured out of their temple.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.adam.intro.prompt5">But please, hurry, I don't know for how long they'll be able to hold on!</string>


	<string name="dialogue.adam.prompt1.1">We'll never be able to repay you.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.adam.prompt1.2">Not only is the cult getting aggressive, the goblins seem to be up to something too!</string>
	<string name="dialogue.adam.prompt2.1">Things are really starting to come together around here.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.adam.prompt2.2">I hope the cult doesn't find us again.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.adam.prompt3">Building like this would never have been possible without you, thank you so much.</string>

	<string name="dialogue.kevin.prompt1.1">These are some great drinks! You should always drink something when going out into the forest, it's much more fun!</string>
	<string name="dialogue.kevin.prompt1.2">There are recipes out there for both food and drinks.</string>

	<string name="dialogue.kelly.prompt1.1">It's such a pet friendly town, my cats love exploring.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.kelly.prompt1.2">This place is cozy, but I'd love to move to one of the bigger houses.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.kelly.prompt1.3">Nice to meet you, you can call me Kelly.</string>


	<string name="dialogue.traveling_monk.prompt1.1">Hey, have we met before?</string>
	<string name="dialogue.traveling_monk.prompt1.2">I am often on the road, traveling to new places where the light has not yet reached.</string>

	<string name="dialogue.elin.prompt1.1">Did you read any of these?</string>
	<string name="dialogue.elin.prompt1.2">There's some great stuff here.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.elin.prompt1.3">Maybe I should bring this to the tavern and read it there.</string>

	<string name="dialogue.grandma.prompt1">I sure hope my grandson drops by soon. I miss him.</string>

	<string name="dialogue.guard_exit.prompt1">Be careful out there!</string>


	<string name="dialogue.librarian.found">Oh hello! I've been looking for a while now, but there's nothing here. Not a single book.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.librarian.prompt1.1">Books are truly something special, they can take you to a different world, a different kind of thought.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.librarian.prompt1.2">You should look in to building a library, it would take this town to the next level.</string>
	
	<string name="dialogue.enchanter.found.1">There are so many enchantments and spells in these books and scrolls.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.enchanter.found.2">This is all very unique, but I need to get out of here. There are threats everywhere here!</string>
	
	<string name="dialogue.architect.found.1">Thank you for saving me, but I fear it might be too late.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.architect.found.2">I never helped them get through the main entrance, but I think they managed to get to the citadel through this crypt.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.architect.prompt1">I'll meet you out in the forest by the citadel.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.architect.prompt2">I'll open this for you.</string>



	<string name="dialogue.rogue.found.1">Hello there! You're also out here looking for treasure?</string>
	<string name="dialogue.rogue.found.2">You have a camp set up? If you have space for me I'll show you some tricks.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.rogue.is_same">Hm. Not sure I trust you.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.rogue.is_other">Consider training someone in the arts, being able to pass more safely through traps is useful.</string>

	<string name="dialogue.warlock.found.1">Be careful! The door is trapped, and besides, the crypts below are very dangerous.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.warlock.found.2">Something is awakening down there, I'm getting out of here and you should do the same.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.warlock.is_same">Good to see you acolyte.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.warlock.is_other">Us at the darker side of magic have more insight than many, this shadow magic is something special.</string>

	<string name="dialogue.sorcerer.found.1">Oh hey! You figured out that door too? It gets harder now.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.sorcerer.found.2">The more candles I light before I continue, the harder the fight. I've not managed to get past the shades yet though, so I'm not sure about what's after.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.sorcerer.is_same">Another student of the elements? Good, they unlock the secrets of the universe.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.sorcerer.is_other">There is magic all around us, all you need to do is channel it.</string>



	<string name="dialogue.hunter.intro1">Oh, has the road collapsed?</string>
	<string name="dialogue.hunter.intro2">You can probably go around by crossing the stream to the west, then heading deeper into the forest to the north.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.hunter.intro3">But be careful, the forests here are dangerous and the road may well have been blocked deliberately.</string>

	<string name="dialogue.hunter.prompt1">Oh, you're setting up a camp? If you can get me the tools I'll teach you how to get the most from the beasts you slay.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.hunter.prompt2.1">I need some better shelter than this tent.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.hunter.prompt2.2">What's going on with these robed idiots running around the forest, do you know anything about that?</string>
	<string name="dialogue.hunter.prompt3">How's it going out there?</string>


	<string name="dialogue.builder.intro.prompt1">Everybody prepare, this is our last stand!</string>
	<string name="dialogue.builder.intro.prompt2.1">Wow, you're a real hero! Thank you so much, we wouldn't have survived without you.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.builder.intro.prompt2.2">Those cultists will never stop coming now that they found us, they've been very aggressive recently.</string>


	<string name="dialogue.apothecary.intro.prompt1.1">Thank you for your help! They tore down my lab, so I'm limited in what I can do for you, but here, have a potion.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.apothecary.intro.prompt1.2">I need a proper apothecary lab to help you further, but I will be able to improve your potion.</string>



	<string name="dialogue.chaplain.intro.prompt1.1">That was so scary, you really arrived like a blessing from above.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.chaplain.intro.prompt1.2">I can take us somewhere safer.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.chaplain.prompt1.1">Those cultists have been trying to enter the Dark Citadel for some time now, but they have been much more aggressive lately. They might be getting close now.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.chaplain.prompt1.2">The Citadel has been closed for centuries; no one knows what happened.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.chaplain.prompt1.3">It would be a big help if you could head north into the forest and investigate this issue.</string>


	<string name="dialogue.subclass.lowlvl">I can't help you yet,\ncome back when you're level 10.</string>


	<string name="dialogue.armorer.rescue">Hey! You know the way to the others?</string>
	<string name="dialogue.armorer.prompt1">Thank you for finding us and getting us here, we'll do what we can to help out.</string>

	<string name="dialogue.blacksmith.rescue">Oh nice, if it was up to my brother here we would be still lost!</string>
	<string name="dialogue.blacksmith.prompt1">This is a nice spot you have here! If you can help us build a smithy I can help with upgrading your equipment.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.blacksmith.prompt2.1">My brother can teach you how to use your armor and weapons more efficiently, if you can get us resources for a proper forge I'll also be able to upgrade your equipment.</string>
	<string name="dialogue.blacksmith.prompt2.2">We also have weapons in the back for sale, they are simple pieces, but of high quality.</string>


	<string name="dialogue.shadowface_cultist.laugh">Hehehe....</string>
